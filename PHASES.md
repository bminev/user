## Phase 1

Create Person class that takes 2 arguments (name and surname). Object of this class
should respond to method `#say_hello` that returns name and surname divided by space.

## Phase 2

Make second argument as optional and check for results from mutant.

## Phase 3

Make code to display name without space after name when there is no surname

and make test for 'Peter' name.

## Phase 5

Improve tests to make sure that is testing other cases than Peter.

## Phase 6

Make it work for name and surname without first capital letter. But still should
display name and surname with first capital letter. Remember about `#peter?` method.
